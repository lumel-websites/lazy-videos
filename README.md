This plugin lazy loads videos on your page by using a placeholder preview image in place of the video. The video loads only when the preview image is clicked. All the scripts and styles for the video are loaded only when the placeholder image is clicked thus improving your site performance as well as increasing your Google PageSpeed/GTMetrix Score.

Lazy videos currently supports loading videos from YouTube, Vimeo and Wistia. Support for more providers will be added in the future.
